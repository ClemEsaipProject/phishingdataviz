# Requirements for a Phishing Prediction Application for Enterprises

## Academic Request - Data Mining Project with Streamlit

### Project Overview and Functional Requirements:
The project aims to develop an application for predicting phishing attacks in enterprises using Data Mining techniques. The goal is to apply the knowledge acquired in data mining to build a robust predictive model.

### Site Objectives:
The application aims to demonstrate the practical application of data mining techniques in the cybersecurity domain by providing an interactive platform for predicting phishing attacks.

### Benchmark:
An analysis of similar tools and techniques will be conducted to understand best practices and the most effective approaches in this field.

### Content:
The application content will include features for data preprocessing, model construction, result visualization, and model performance evaluation.

## Functional Solution

### Target Audience:
The target users of the application are students in computer science, cybersecurity, or data science interested in applying data mining techniques in a real-world context.

### Mobile Web:
The application will be developed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating interactive web applications. It will be accessible via a standard web browser.

### Site Structure:
The organization of pages and functionalities of the application will be structured to allow smooth navigation and intuitive use.

### UML Diagrams:
UML diagrams will be used to model the architecture of the application, including the different layers (user interface, business logic, data access) and their interactions.

## Project Organization

### Resources Allocated to the Project:
Human resources (participating students), hardware resources (computers, servers), and software resources (development environment, Python libraries) will be allocated to successfully carry out the project.

### Technological Choices:
The choice of Streamlit as a development platform will be justified by its ease of use, flexibility, and ability to create interactive web applications using Python code.

### Development and Hosting:
The application development will take place on GitHub, with free hosting of the code. Demo versions will be available online for continuous evaluation of the project.

### Applied Methodology:
An agile methodology will be followed, with 2-hour work sessions per day. One hour will be dedicated to documentation and technological watch, while the other hour will be devoted to actual code development.

### Story Map:
A story map will be developed to define the application features, prioritize them, and track their implementation throughout the project.

### Cost and Revenue:
Development costs will be minimized by using open-source tools and resources wherever possible. The success of the project will be measured by user satisfaction and the quality of the developed predictive model.
